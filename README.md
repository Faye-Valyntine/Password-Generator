# Password-Generator
JS project I made in college that generates a password for the user. It takes whatever integer the user types in and creates a random password that many characters long.
The password can contain any combination of digits, lowercase letter, uppercase letters and a few symbols. If the user doesn't enter a valid integer, the program alerts the user.
